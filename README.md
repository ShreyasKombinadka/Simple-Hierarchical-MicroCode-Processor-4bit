**imple Hirarchial MicroCode Processer - 4bit ( SHMCP-4 )**
---

**This is my custom 4-bit processer based on the Breadboard version that i am working on**

As the name suggests its a basic microcded processer that can run basic programms, i built it to get an basic understanding of computer architecture and it was also fun to design and build.
